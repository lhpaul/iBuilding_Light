  "readme": "# formatter\n\n<a href=\"http://travis-ci.org/#!/DamonOehlman/formatter\"><img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/DamonOehlman/formatter.png\" alt=\"Build Status\"></a>\n\nThis is a simple library designed to do one thing and one thing only - replace variables in strings with variable values.  It is built in such a way that the formatter strings are parsed and you are provided with a function than can efficiently be called to provide the custom output.\n\n__NOTE__: Formatter is not designed to be a templating library and if you are already using something like Handlebars or [hogan](https://github.com/twitter/hogan.js) in your library or application stack consider using them instead.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n// create the \"I like food formatter\"\nvar likefood = formatter('I like {{ 0 }}, {{ 0 }} is excellent and kicks the pants off {{ 1 }}.');\n\n// I can then log out how much I like bacon\nconsole.log(likefood('bacon', 'bread'));\n```\n\nIf you have a look at your console output, you should see the following:\n\n```\nI like bacon, bacon is excellent and kicks the pants off bread.\n```\n\n## Using named variables\n\nIn the examples above we saw how the formatter can be used to replace function arguments in a formatter string.  We can also set up a formatter to use particular key values from an input string instead if that is more suitable:\n\n```js\n// create the \"I like food formatter\" (named style)\nvar likefood = formatter('I like {{ great }}, {{ great }} is excellent and kicks the pants off {{ poor }}.');\n\n// I can then log out how much I like bacon\nconsole.log(likefood({ great: 'bacon', poor: 'bread' }));\n```\n\nThis will yield the same output as our first example.\n\n### Nested Property Values\n\nSince version `0.1.0` you can also access nested property values, as you can with templates like handlebars.\n\n## Performance\n\nI've done some [performance benchmarks](http://jsperf.com/formatter-performance) and formatter is faster than handlebars, but that isn't surprising as it is far simpler and doesn't have the smarts of HBS.  The test is really there to ensure that I didn't do anything too silly...\n\nAdditionally, it should be noted that using formatter is 100% slower than concatenating strings, so don't use it where performance is critical.  Do use it where not repeating yourself is.\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Length Modifier (len)\n\nThe length modifier is used to ensure that a string is exactly the length specified.  The string is sliced to the required max length, and then padded out with spaces (or a specified character) to meet the required length.\n\n```js\n// pad the string test to 10 characters\nformatter('{{ 0|len:10 }}')('test');   // 'test      '\n\n// pad the string test to 10 characters, using a as the padding character\nformatter('{{ 0|len:10:a }}')('test'); // 'testaaaaaa'\n```",
